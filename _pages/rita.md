Told in this project is the story of Rita, a laying hen who experiences the different forms of the egg industry. But Rita is no regular „egg-worker“. Little by little, she discovers her own basic instincts and does not hesitate to fight for them.

## CONTEXT
In late 2016 three institutions collaborated for an interdisciplinary experiment: the [University of Applied Sciences Potsdam](https://www.en.fh-potsdam.de/), [Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin](https://www.hu-berlin.de/en?set_language=en) and [IRI THESys](https://www.iri-thesys.org/), a research institute focussing on the transformation of human-environment systems. Approached was the relationship of humankind and the chicken, an animal omnipresent in our societies' mass consumption. Over a course of several months different perspectives were explored, discussed and classified. Recurrent was the consultation of ethical evaluations related to the use of chickens in our food industries.

Within this framework, RITA was born, a "revolutionary" laying hen and an invitation to question and reflect on conditions in the egg industry.

## PROJECT
Based on an extensive research the project was implemented as an illustrated short story. Five chapters, representing five stages in RITA's life and five conditions in the german laying hen industry.

Each chapter consists of a fictional plot, integrating one or more actual circumstances, a section that offers respective sources and a sketched black-and-white illustration.

The project was publicised in different ways. Its framing class concluded with a public presentation in Berlin. Present were experts from the fields of design, biology, agriculture and more. RITA's story was presented as a reading with a subsequent discussion on ethical and other relevant considerations.

In order to also display the project in the exhibitions [WERKSCHAU](https://fhp-werkschau.de/) and [Lange Nacht der Wissenschaften](https://www.langenachtderwissenschaften.de/) the story was printed on posters and partly on flyers. The [website](https://dnsos.github.io/ritasgeschichte/en) documents RITA's story and the project.
