# INTRO
Told in this project is the story of Rita, a laying hen who experiences the different forms of the egg industry. But Rita is no regular „egg-worker“. Little by little, she discovers her own basic instincts and does not hesitate to fight for them.

# CONTEXT
In late 2016 three institutions collaborated for an interdisciplinary experiment: the [University of Applied Sciences Potsdam](https://www.en.fh-potsdam.de/), [Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin](https://www.hu-berlin.de/en?set_language=en) and [IRI THESys](https://www.iri-thesys.org/), a research institute focussing on the transformation of human-environment systems. Approached was the relationship of humankind and the chicken, an animal omnipresent in our society's mass consumption. Over a course of several months different perspectives were explored, discussed and classified. Recurrent was the consultation of ethical evaluations related to the use of chickens in our food industries.

Within this framework, RITA was born, a "revolutionary" laying hen and an invitation to question and reflect on conditions in the egg industry.

# PROJECT
Based on a wide-ranging research the project was implemented as an illustrated short story. Five chapters, representing five stages in Rita's life and five conditions in the german laying hen industry.

Each chapter consists of a fictional plot, integrating one or more real circumstances, a section that offers respective sources and a sketched black-and-white illustration.

The project was publicised in different ways. By the end of

In order to also display the project for the exhibitions "Werkschau" and "Lange Nacht der Wissenschaften" the story was also printed on posters and partly on flyers.
