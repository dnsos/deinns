The sea level rise caused by climate change endangers cities, regions and whole countries everywhere in the world. Germany is barely, its capital Berlin not at all, affected. But what if Berlin was fictionally transferred to a coastal area, affected by sea level rise?

## CONTEXT
In summer 2017 the _University of Applied Sciences Potsdam_ organised a semester under the motto _Politiken des Designs_ (Politics of Design). As it is a topic of major relevance, I chose to develop a project that was intended to raise awareness about social consequences of climate change that are already happening now. The results of this work were displayed in the annual exhibition [WERKSCHAU](https://fhp-werkschau.de/) and later – due to the positive resonance to the concept _Politiken des Designs_ – in an  [exhibition with the same name](https://politikendesdesigns.de/).

## PROJECT
The idea behind the project combines two common tools of communicating climate change: __map-based visualisations and narration__.

Berlin is on average 34 meters above sea level. For the project, the official altitude data of the city of Berlin were used – 34 meters were subtracted from each measuring point. This creates a relative image of a Berlin at sea level. The areas below sea level are blue – the darker the blue, the deeper the area.

In several scenarios, critical points are shown that are imperative for the functioning of the social structure. For each scenario, a real event from the past is referenced to clarify the relevance of the threat. __By fictionally bringing the sea level rise to Berlin, recipients are invited to reflect about the consequences of climate change happening already now in other parts of the world__.
