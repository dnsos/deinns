The sea level rise caused by climate change endangers cities, regions and whole countries everywhere in the world. Germany is barely, its capital Berlin not at all, affected. But what if Berlin was fictionally transferred to a coastal area, affected by sea level rise? [In different scenarios this project points to the close relation between natural events and developments and the functionality of societies. Fictional in Berlin, real in other parts of the world.]

# CONTEXT
In summer 2017 the University of Applied Sciences Potsdam organised one whole semester under the Slogan "Politiken des Designs" (Politics of Design). As it is a topic of relevance, I chose to develop a project that was intended to raise awareness about social consequences of climate change.
