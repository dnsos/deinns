Collected here are works that I developed as part of university courses over the last years.

## NON VERBAL EXPLANATION OF A PROCESS
The challenge of this project was to visualise a complex process without using text. I worked with the concept of writing and sending a _PGP_ encrypted mail.

## CONCEPT AND INTERFACE FOR A BRAINSTORMING APP
In this project I, together with Moritz Gruhl, developed the concept and interface for a Brainstorming App. We first visualised the concept and user journey and afterwards build an interface based on the _iOS design guidelines_.

## REDESIGN GUITAR TUNER
In this project I redesigned the interface of a hardware: a guitar and bass tuner. After examining, understanding and visualising the application structure, I developed an alternative screen-based interface more appropriate to the hardwares' actual functionality.

## SOUND VISUALISATION
Visualisation of amplitudes of sound using the library _p5.js_ and the song [Let's write the sheets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qb0HGvEWIJc) by _Hundreds_ as an example.
