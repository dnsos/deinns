Collected here are works that I developed as part of university courses in 2015 and 2016.

## NON VERBAL EXPLANATION OF A PROCESS
The challenge of this project was to __visualise a complex process without using text__. I worked with the concept of writing and sending a _PGP_ encrypted mail.

## CONCEPT AND INTERFACE FOR A BRAINSTORMING APP
In this project I, together with Moritz Gruhl, developed the concept and interface for a Brainstorming App. We first visualised the __concept and user journey__ and afterwards built an __interface based on the _iOS design guidelines___.

## REDESIGN GUITAR TUNER
In this project I redesigned the interface of a hardware: a guitar and bass tuner. After examining, understanding and visualising the __application structure__, I developed an alternative __screen-based interface__ more appropriate to the hardwares' actual functionality.

## SOUND VISUALISATION
__Visualisation of amplitudes of sound__ using the library _p5.js_ and the song [Let's write the sheets](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qb0HGvEWIJc) by _Hundreds_ as an example.
